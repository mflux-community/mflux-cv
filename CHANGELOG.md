## [0.18.39] - 2026-08-09

### 🎨 New Features

- **Microsoft Lens (Turbo)** (`mflux-generate-lens`, `--model lens-turbo` / `lens`): first MLX-native implementation of the 3.8B dual-stream MMDiT with GPT-OSS 20B multi-layer text features and the FLUX.2 VAE, requested upstream in [#424](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/issues/424). The encoder is vendored from mlx-lm (no new dependency, bit-identical to the original) and captures the residual stream after blocks 5/11/17/23 under the frozen harmony template with the 97-token offset; the 48-block denoiser loads the community checkpoint at 1264/1264 tensor coverage with no mapping layer; components resolve from their three homes (Comfy-Org mirror, mlx-community conversion, klein VAE). ~0.1 s/step denoising at 512x512, 4 steps, CFG internalized (`--guidance`/`--negative-prompt` declared ignored, reported honestly by warnings and `mflux-capabilities`). Turbo only for now; seed-parity against the ComfyUI reference is the planned follow-up. (#61)

## [0.18.38] - 2026-08-08

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Qwen-Image 4-bit no longer accumulates quantization noise across steps** (upstream [#484](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/issues/484)): at uniform q4, flat-field noise grows monotonically with step count (sigma 5.06 to 16.07 from 4 to 50 steps on Qwen-Image-2512) and the practical step optimum collapses. Bisection showed the whole effect lives in the adaLN modulation producers: `-q 4` now keeps the 60 `img_mod_linear` layers at 8-bit (~1.8 GB extra), which restores the global-q8 noise floor exactly (sigma 1.10/1.37 at 20/50 steps vs 1.15/1.31 for full q8). Same protected-layer choice as upstream [#420](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/pull/420), so saves interoperate; qwen-edit and qwen-image-flash share the definition and inherit the fix. On the loading side, stored quantized models are reconstructed at the exact per-layer bits and group size inferred from the saved shapes plus the module's true input dimension, so mixed saves round-trip pixel-identically (verified: 26 GB save, mean abs diff 0.0) and uniform saves load exactly as before. (#60)

## [0.18.37] - 2026-08-07

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Klein edit references are encoded at their own aspect-preserved size** (upstream [#385](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/issues/385)): reference images were resized to the output dimensions, stretching them whenever the aspects differed. The CLI masked it by defaulting dimensions to the reference; it always bit on secondary references in multi-image edits and with explicit `--width`/`--height`. Now diffusers parity, scoped to the Klein helper: each reference keeps its own size, capped near 1MP preserving aspect and snapped down to multiples of 16 by center-crop, so nothing gets squashed. Packing and position ids derive from the encoded shape and needed no changes. The two wide-reference goldens moved exactly as the investigation predicted (6.7% and 9.4%, visually reviewed) and both dalmatian goldens, predicted stable, passed against their previous references, including the 9b-kv variant validated after its 41GB download. (#57)
- **Flash follow-ups from the adversarial review round**: `--base-model` was dropped when the qwen CLI resolved the model name, and running Flash through the edit CLI double-applied CFG. The edit CLI now warns and forces guidance 1.0 for distilled configs, and the variant defends itself with an identity gate that leaves base qwen's true CFG intact. (#56)
- **mlx floor raised to 0.32.0 on macOS** (upstream [#489](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/pull/489)): mlx below 0.32.0 silently corrupts `quantized_matmul` once the input matrix passes 32768 rows. Reproduced here before porting: at 40000 rows the whole result is garbage on 0.31.0 and exact on 0.32.0. Quantized SeedVR2 at large output sizes runs straight into that path. The lockfile was also refreshed to match the current pyproject. (#58)

### 🏠 Project

- **Releases can publish to PyPI through trusted publishing (OIDC)**: a workflow triggered by release publication builds with uv and uploads without any long-lived token. Gated behind the `PYPI_TRUSTED_PUBLISHING` repository variable until the PyPI side is configured; the manual publish path keeps working unchanged. (#59)

## [0.18.36] - 2026-08-06

### 🎨 New Features

- **nvidia/Qwen-Image-Flash** (`--model qwen-image-flash` / `qwen-flash`): NVIDIA's DMD2 4-step distillation of Qwen-Image, with a transformer byte-identical to Qwen-Image-2512, so the 20B Qwen goes from minutes to about 24 seconds of denoising (768x768, q8, M5 Max; peak 40.78 GB). CFG is internalized per the model card: guidance is forced to 1.0, the per-step negative transformer pass is skipped entirely (halving per-step cost), and `--guidance`/`--negative-prompt` are declared conditional so the runtime warnings and `mflux-capabilities` report them correctly. The static shift-3 schedule is expressed through the existing sigma schema (base shift == max shift == ln 3), producing exactly `[1.0, 0.9, 0.75, 0.5, 0.0]` at any resolution. The qwen CLI also now resolves `--model` (it previously ignored it). (#55)

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Golden-image comparator: `atol` defaults to 2** (upstream #467/#491): the hardcoded `atol=0` collapsed tolerance to exact-match on near-black pixels, flagging visually identical dark references. Overridable via `MFLUX_IMAGE_ALLCLOSE_ATOL`, mirroring the rtol knob. (#52)
- **`--no-metadata`** (upstream #437): opt out of embedding generation parameters (EXIF UserComment and friends) in the output image. Default unchanged; independent of `--metadata`, which additionally writes the JSON sidecar. (#53)
- **flux README no longer references nonexistent `tools/` scripts** (upstream #411): the inpaint section gives real mask guidance and the outpaint section uses the shipped `ImageUtil` helpers, snippet executed and verified. (#54)

## [0.18.35] - 2026-08-04

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`--base-model <alias>` with no `--model` crashed with an error blaming the vae**: `from_name` returned a differently shaped config depending on which keyword named the model, handing back `model_name=None` through the `base_model` keyword; every FLUX initializer read that None as the weights path and the failure surfaced as `No root_path and no download_url for component: vae` on a fully cached repository. The alias now resolves to its own table entry, so both keywords yield the same config shape, and the loader reports a missing root path once, up front, as the whole-model condition it is (components satisfied by direct download URLs or per-component path overrides are exempt). Field-reported with the full diagnosis; regression tests cover every base alias in `AVAILABLE_MODELS`. Offered upstream as [#501](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/pull/501). (#46)
- **ComfyUI-format LoRAs (tensors named `lora_A`/`lora_B` with no trailing `.weight`) matched nothing in every family except FLUX.1**: matching is exact string equality and every suffix pattern outside flux ends in `.weight`, so a correct adapter died with "No LoRA layers were applied". The matcher now accepts the bare spelling for every `.weight` pattern centrally, closing the gap in flux2, qwen, z-image, ernie, ideogram4 and krea2 at once, and the zero-match error names the key endings it saw against what the mapping expects, so a naming-format mismatch (or a file of full-weight `.diff` deltas) reads as what it is. Field-reported with a working patch and a fixed-seed A/B; the fix lands one level below the patch. Offered upstream as [#505](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/pull/505). (#49)
- **`mflux-capabilities` hardening from the late review round**: a mapping default whose keys collide when stringified now raises instead of publishing an incomplete record, and the conditional/mapping regression tests pin more of the contract. (#47)

## [0.18.34] - 2026-08-02

### 🎨 New Features

- **`mflux-capabilities`: a machine-readable contract of what each CLI actually honours** (from the [#357](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/issues/357) discussion, with the [#498](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/issues/498) evidence base). Downstream tools transcribe capability tables from `--help`, and `--help` overstates: some models read options and discard them. The dump is self-healing by construction, with no hand-maintained registry to rot: commands come from the installed console scripts, options and `parser_default`s from each CLI's live `build_parser()` (the idiom extracted across all 27 generate CLIs), and the honoured/ignored/conditional classification is the same constant the runtime warnings read, so dump and warnings cannot disagree. Output: JSON (default), YAML when PyYAML is present, and a markdown rendering for humans and llms.txt-style docs. Offered upstream as [#499](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/pull/499). (#41)

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Field-reported capability fixes**, from a downstream consumer who diffed the dump against their hand-maintained table (13 of 16 models agreed, and the dump caught a regression on their side): parser defaults now normalize to wire types at record-build time (a `Path` default truncated the streamed JSON mid-value) with the JSON serialized to a string before writing; and mapping defaults stay JSON objects rather than repr strings. (#43, #44)
- **Eight flux-family commands now tell the truth about `--negative-prompt` and `--guidance`**: the controlnet, depth, fill, redux, kontext and the three in-context CLIs all accepted `--negative-prompt` and never read it while the dump reported it honoured, and the base and controlnet CLIs honour `--guidance` on dev but drop it on schnell (no guidance embedder is built). All declared, wired to runtime warnings keyed on the resolved model, and regression-pinned. (#43, #44)

### 🏠 Project

- **Synced with upstream**: the stepwise VAE-routing fix and its 104-line regression test file, by [@plz12345](https://github.com/plz12345) (upstream [#444](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/pull/444)); `cv/main..upstream/main` is empty again. The 0.18.28 defensive lora-paths read in the stepwise handler is now pinned by a test covering attribute-less models, the same fix offered upstream as [#500](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/pull/500) where the crash still reproduces. (#42, #45)

## [0.18.33] - 2026-08-01

### 🎨 New Features

- **NVIDIA PiD pixel-diffusion decoder (`--pid-decode`)**: replaces the VAE decode with NVIDIA's PiD, a 4x super-resolving re-render of the final latents, so a 512x512 generation decodes straight to 2048x2048. Wired on FLUX.1, FLUX.2 Klein, Qwen Image, Krea 2, ERNIE, Ideogram 4 and Z-Image (which shares Flux's latent space and uses its PiD checkpoint). Opt-in and off by default; the normal decode path is untouched. Weights download at runtime: one `model_ema_bf16.pth` per VAE family from `nvidia/PiD` plus `google/gemma-2-2b-it` (gated, accept the license once). `--pid-degrade-sigma` trades source fidelity for invented detail, and with `--pid-decode` the transformer is evicted the moment the denoising loop ends, which upstream measured as a straight win. From upstream [#490](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/pull/490) by @azrahello at its post-review state, with the degrade-sigma piece co-authored by @plz12345, who also verified it with real runs on five model families. Documented behaviors carried as-is: the 4x output re-draws rather than sharpens, portrait skin can over-texture, and flux2-checkpoint families show a small green drift with an upstream correction promised as follow-up. One deliberate divergence: the sampler threads explicit RNG keys instead of reseeding the global stream, so multi-seed runs stay reproducible with and without `--pid-decode`. (#40)

## [0.18.32] - 2026-08-01

### 🐛 Fixes

- **FLUX.2 CLIs discarded all image metadata**: both FLUX.2 CLIs called `ImageUtil.save_image(...)` without `metadata=`, so `--metadata` wrote a sidecar JSON containing literal `null`. They now route through `GeneratedImage.save(...)` like every other entry point, which embeds and exports the real parameters. Cherry-pick of upstream [#492](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/pull/492), fix by @plz12345. (#36)
- **EXIF orientation is applied when loading images**: `ImageUtil.load_image` ignored the EXIF Orientation tag, so most photos straight off a phone reached the model sideways. The model is conditioned on the rotated pixels, so edit variants produced wrong output rather than correctly-oriented output that needs a flip. `exif_transpose` now runs on both the path and in-memory branches and strips the tag it applies, so a downstream save cannot double-rotate. Reported upstream as [#495](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/issues/495). (#37)
- **`--steps 1` crashed FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler**: the linear spacing divides by `(num_steps - 1)`, and guarding just that denominator moves the crash into `_stretch_to_terminal`, which would start denoising from nearly-clean noise. `num_steps == 1` now returns the 1-step schedule the class's sibling paths already define, sigmas `[1.0, 0.0]`, one full Euler step; every other step count is byte-identical, pinned by regression tests. Affected FLUX.2 Klein, FIBO, and Z-Image with guidance active. Reported upstream as [#494](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/issues/494). (#38)

### ✨ Improvements

- **CLIs warn when an option the model cannot honour is dropped**: the shared argparse exposes `--negative-prompt` and `--guidance` on every image CLI, but FLUX.1 reads the negative prompt and discards it unused, Ideogram 4 accepts the flag without a parameter for it, Z-Image Turbo overrides an explicit `--guidance` to 0.0 and never encodes the negative, and Boogu accepts both and passes neither. One policy now: the options stay accepted so existing scripts keep working, and the CLI says out loud what it is dropping. Warnings key on the effective post-resolution behavior, so `--model z-image-turbo` through the generic CLI and the omitted-`--guidance` default (0.0, CFG disabled) warn correctly. Abbreviated long options (argparse prefix matching, e.g. `--negative`) are now rejected parser-wide: the provision scan cannot see abbreviations, and an abbreviation that is unambiguous today breaks silently the moment a new option shares its prefix. (#39)

## [0.18.31] - 2026-07-30

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Ideogram 4 models saved with a LoRA could not be loaded back**: baking a LoRA over the fp8 base folds the adapted layers to MLX q8, so the checkpoint stores a packed `weight` plus `scales`/`biases` for those layers. On reload the fresh `Fp8Linear` modules cannot hold those tensors and the native checkpoint validation rejected the save (missing `weight_scale`, unexpected `scales`/`biases`). The large fp8 layers also defer allocation until the weight update fills them, and the validator read those empty placeholders as shape mismatches. Folded layers are now rebuilt as `QuantizedLinear` before validation, and zero-size placeholders are exempt from the shape check; a fill that never happens still fails loudly in the `Fp8Linear` forward. (#35)
- **A reloaded Ideogram save generated with the wrong CFG negative**: baking strips the LoRA wrappers, so nothing marked the checkpoint as a LoRA model and the empty prompt ran through the clean unconditional transformer. Full guidance then amplifies the baked LoRA delta: the subject holds but the prompt scene washes out. `mflux-save` now records the baked LoRA (file names and scales) in `mflux_model_config.json`, and the loader keeps the negative routed through the conditional transformer when the marker is present. A save/reload round-trip now reproduces the live-LoRA generation pixel-identically. Saves made before this release carry no marker, so re-save them to pick up the routing. (#35)

## [0.18.30] - 2026-07-30

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Qwen VAE saved models could not be loaded back**: any natively saved Qwen-VAE model (Qwen Image, Qwen Image Edit, Qwen-Image-Layered, and Krea 2 Turbo, Raw and Depth) failed to load with a `shape_mismatches` error on five `decoder.mid_block.*` tensors. `QwenImageRMSNorm` initialized its gamma with spatial trailing dimensions while the checkpoints store it one-dimensional, a mismatch dating back to upstream #269. The native checkpoint integrity validation added with Mage Flow (#483) turned that latent difference into a hard load failure. Gamma is now initialized in the checkpoint's own shape; the forward path already reshaped either form, and output is bit-identical on both the 4D image and 5D video paths. (fix by @fortinmike)

## [0.18.29] - 2026-07-28

### ✨ Improvements

- **Faster SeedVR2 histogram matching**: the inverse permutation in `_hist_match` was built with `argsort(argsort(x))`, an O(n log n) sort standing in for what a single scatter gives in O(n). Measured on an M5 Max at 4M elements, roughly one channel of a 1080p frame: 880 ms → 17.3 ms per channel. Output is identical, including with repeated values where the stable-sort semantics could have broken. (#488, upstream PR by @Missing-Identity)

### 📖 Documentation

- **Contributors section**: an avatar grid of the people whose ports and fixes make up this build, over tables read out of the git history with every row linking its PR. Corrects three attributions that a hand-written table gets wrong: Krea 2 is @plz12345 (#453), Ideogram 4 is @omercelik (#433), ERNIE-Image is @azrahello (#417).
- Writes up 0.18.27 and 0.18.28, which shipped to PyPI without a changelog entry or a GitHub release.
- Package URLs now point at this repository. The PyPI page linked only to upstream, so there was no route from the package to the source of the build being installed.

### 🏠 Project

- The repository was transferred to the [mflux-community](https://github.com/mflux-community) organization. Stars, releases, issues and pull requests travelled with it, and the old URL is a permanent redirect for both web and git, so existing clones and `pip install git+` lines keep working.

## [Unreleased]

### 🎨 New Model Support

- **Krea 2**: Add text-to-image support for `krea/Krea-2-Turbo` — a single-stream MMDiT built on the Qwen-Image stack (Qwen-Image VAE + a 12-layer Qwen3-VL-4B text-encoder tap). Includes the `mflux-generate-krea2` CLI (live progress, `--metadata`, stepwise output), `er_sde` and Euler samplers, and `mflux-save` quantization caching.
- **Krea 2 Raw + LoRA training**: Add `krea/Krea-2-Raw` as a trainable base and `mflux-train` LoRA training for Krea 2 (flow-matching velocity, QLoRA over the quantized base, gradient checkpointing across the 28 blocks). The transformer also loads from the diffusers `transformer/` shard layout in addition to the native single-file checkpoint, and the official `krea/Krea-2-LoRA-*` adapters load as-is. Train on Raw, run the adapter on Turbo (Krea's recommended workflow). (#462)

### ✨ Features

- **LyCORIS LoKr adapters (FLUX.1 and FLUX.2)**: Load community LyCORIS LoKr safetensors through the existing `--lora-paths` / `lora_paths` API. Supports direct and factorized (`lokr_w1_a`/`lokr_w1_b`, `lokr_w2_a`/`lokr_w2_b`, optional `lokr_t2`) tensors, observed LyCORIS key layouts, alpha scaling for decomposed factors, optional `dora_scale`, multi-adapter fusion with classic LoRA, and baking into non-quantized base weights as well as quantized layers (via dequantization and re-quantization). Inference applies the Kronecker product without materializing full dense deltas for standard (non-DoRA) LoKr layers.

### ✨ Improvements

- **Faster SeedVR2 histogram matching**: The inverse permutation in `_hist_match` was built with `argsort(argsort(x))`, an O(n log n) sort used to compute something a single scatter gives in O(n). Measured on an M5 Max at 4M elements, roughly one channel of a 1080p frame: **880 ms → 17.3 ms per channel**. Output is bit-identical, including with repeated values, where the stable-sort semantics could have broken. (#488, upstream PR by @Missing-Identity)
- **Atomic `--lora` and `--image` flags**: Pair each path with its value on a single, repeatable flag — `--lora A.safetensors 0.7 --lora B.safetensors` (scale defaults to `1.0`) and `--image photo.jpg 0.6` (strength defaults to the model default). This removes the positional-alignment footgun of the parallel `--lora-paths`/`--lora-scales` and `--image-path`/`--image-strength` lists, which remain fully supported and are marked deprecated in `--help`. (#357)
- **`--vae-tiling` and `--vae-tile-size` flags**: Restore user-facing control over tiled VAE decoding, decoupled from `--low-ram` (previously the only way to enable it). `--vae-tiling` enables tiled decode with the default 512px tiles; `--vae-tile-size 256` shrinks the tiles to further reduce peak decode memory and implies `--vae-tiling`. Both compose with `--low-ram`, whose implicit tiling defaults they override. The original `--vae-tiling`/`--vae-tiling-split` flags were removed in the Z-Image refactor (#284); this restores the capability on top of the generalized `VAETiler`. (#311, #407)

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-07

### 🎨 New Model Support

- **ERNIE-Image & ERNIE-Image-Turbo**: Port Baidu's ERNIE-Image models with text-to-image CLI entrypoints, LoRA inference and training, and `mflux-save` support.
- **Ideogram 4 FP8**: Add Ideogram 4 FP8 text-to-image support with JSON caption handling, FP8 safetensors loading, and a dedicated CLI entrypoint.

### ✨ Improvements

- **FLUX.2 Klein 9B KV-cache**: Add KV-cache support for `flux2-klein-9b-kv` with roughly 2.4× speedup on multi-reference edit workloads.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **FLUX.2 Klein Edit guidance**: Allow `--guidance > 1.0` for FLUX.2 Klein edits by checking the resolved FLUX.2 model config instead of requiring a base model name; defaults remain unchanged.
- **FLUX.2 Klein `mflux-generate`**: Fix `FileNotFoundError: text_encoder_2` by routing Klein models through `Flux2Klein` and skipping the unused T5/`text_encoder_2` weight path.
- **Memory management**: Evict the text encoder after encoding and clear the MLX cache between seeds on multi-seed runs to prevent OOM on large models such as FLUX.2 Klein 9B.

## [0.17.5] - 2026-04-10

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Qwen Image Edit `mflux-save`**: Route Qwen edit model names to `QwenImageEdit` and save through the same path as inference so VisionTransformer (`encoder.visual`) weights are written. Saving with `QwenImage` previously omitted those weights and led to random vision encoders after reload.
- **Battery saver callback**: Harden Apple Silicon battery detection when `system_profiler` is missing and resolve the helper script via absolute paths.

### 📝 Documentation

  - Removed model-specific tokenizer handlers (`clip_tokenizer.py`, `t5_tokenizer.py`, etc.)
- **Unified LoRA API**: Simplified LoRA loading to a single `lora_paths` parameter
  - All LoRA formats now resolved through `LoRALibrary.resolve_paths()`:
    - Local paths: `/path/to/lora.safetensors`
    - Registry names: `my-lora` (from `LORA_LIBRARY_PATH`)
    - HuggingFace repos: `author/model`
    - **New**: HuggingFace collections: `repo_id:filename.safetensors`
  - Simplified model initialization: just pass `lora_paths` and everything resolves automatically
- **Unified Latent Creator Interface**: Standardized `unpack_latents(latents, height, width)` signature across all model families
  - `FluxLatentCreator`, `ZImageLatentCreator`, `FiboLatentCreator`, and `QwenLatentCreator` now share the same interface

  - Removed `RuntimeConfig` class - internal complexity eliminated
  - Added `Flux1` export to main `mflux` module for cleaner imports
- **LoRA API simplified** (programmatic users only):
  - Removed `lora_names` and `lora_repo_id` parameters from all model classes (`Flux1`, `QwenImage`, `QwenImageEdit`, etc.)
  - Removed `--lora-name` and `--lora-repo-id` CLI arguments
  - Removed `LoRAHuggingFaceDownloader` class

### 🔄 Breaking Changes (CLI)

- **`--path` flag removed**: The deprecated `--path` flag for loading models has been removed. Use `--model` instead for local paths, HuggingFace repos, or predefined model names.

### 📦 Dependency Updates

- **Updated `huggingface-hub`** from `>=0.24.5,<1.0` to `>=1.1.6,<2.0`

- **`--model` flag not working**: Fixed bug where the `--model` argument wasn't being used for loading models from HuggingFace or local paths. All CLI commands now correctly use `--model` for model path resolution.
- **Model Saving Index File**: Fixed issue where locally saved models (via `mflux-save`) would fail to load when uploaded to HuggingFace, due to missing `model.safetensors.index.json`. The model saver now generates this index file alongside the safetensor shards, ensuring compatibility with both mflux and standard HuggingFace loading paths. (see [#285](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/issues/285))

### 🧪 Test Infrastructure

- **Test markers**: Added `fast` and `slow` pytest markers to categorize tests
  - Fast tests: Unit tests that don't generate images (parsers, schedulers, resolution, utilities)

  - `make test-fast` - Run fast tests only (quick feedback during development)
  - `make test-slow` - Run slow tests only (image generation tests)
  - `make test` - Run all tests (unchanged)
- Run specific test categories: `pytest -m fast` or `pytest -m slow`
- **GitHub Actions CI**: Fast tests now run automatically on PRs and pushes to main

### 🔧 Internal Changes

- Simplified `WeightLoader.load()` to take a single `model_path` parameter instead of separate `repo_id` and `local_path`
- Simplified `TokenizerLoader.load_all()` with the same unified `model_path` interface
- Renamed `local_path` parameter to `model_path` in all model constructors for clarity
- Removed `quantization_util.py` - quantization now handled through `QuantizationResolution`
- Removed `lora_huggingface_downloader.py` - downloading integrated into `LoRAResolution`
- Added comprehensive test coverage for resolution modules
